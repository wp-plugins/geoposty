Geoposty determines your visitor's location from their ip address, then displays dynamic content that is specific to their area.

== Description ==

Geoposty shows each of your readers information that is unique to their location and relevant to your site.

First, we combine your user's ip address with the world's most accurate database of geoip information.

Next, we use your custom search term/text/point of interest and combine it with reliable APIs from Google and others.

Mix it all together and you get the most relevant, personalized, location-specific content that ever made a WordPress user happy.

Of course, you can try before you buy. The first month costs you nothing (up to 10,000 visitors!), then we offer many subscription levels to meet individual site's needs.

As of this release, you can insert dynamic content items or shortcodes into pages or posts, and control who sees them based on their location or distance from a location. Additionally, there are four sidebar widgets to choose from, and you can have any number or combination of them active on your site at any time.

 

Post/Page Features:

Insert local weather

Insert Google map with custom search and size settings

Insert Shortcodes: These are geo-ip-specific fields that will dynamically populate accurately for your visitor's location, as indicated by their ip address

Location-based display settings: You can customize who sees what content, based on their actual location (state, city, zip, metro area, etc.)

Radius-based display settings: You can customize who see what content, based on their distance from a location (address) that you indicate.

Redirect and display settings: You can set up redirects based on the location of your user.

 

Sidebar Widgets:

Sidebar Content: You write your custom text, GeoPosty will drop in the reader's location, and they feel welcome and recognized.
Maps: You indicate what feature or point of interest you want the map to highlight and your reader sees a local area map with those features.
Weather: All you have to do is turn it on and it will display a simple daily local weather report to each reader.
Businesses: Pick your search term and the number of items and your readers will see relevant local business listings.
Shortcodes: Drop the variables in your page content and GeoPosty automatically populates it with user-specific information such as ip address, zip code, country or city.[1]
