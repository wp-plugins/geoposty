With GeoPosty you can create, customize and display WordPress content that is geographically relevant to each of your visitors.

== Description ==

= The Ultimate Geolocation Plugin! =

GeoPosty enables you to show your site visitors information that is unique and relevant to their specific geographic locations.  First, it combines your user’s ip address with the world’s most accurate database of geoip information. Next, it uses your custom content and/or search terms and combines it with reliable APIs from Google and others. The result is a fantastic cascade of geo-specific content across your site that your vistors will find relevant, personalized, and--not least of all--useful.

GeoPosty comes with 30 days or 10,000-hits (whichever occurs first) worth of free data from Quova.

1. Download the .zip file, extract, and upload the `wp-geoposty` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress site.
